                    <h3><strong>Regular Meetings</strong> </h3>
                    <br/>

                    <h4><strong>Daily Check Ins</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        Every day at 2:00pm CST (with the exception of the week of June 13th, where we will meet every day at 3:30pm) we have a brief check in meeting to discuss what each of us been up to for the past 24 hours and what we will be working on next. The purpose of this meeting is to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Keep everyone updated on each other's progress</li>
                            <li>Get input and feedback from one another about what we've been working on</li>
                            <li>Get help from one another if any of us are stuck</li>
                            <li>Provide a chance to socially connect on a regular basis</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>


                    <h4><strong>Weekly HCI BYOL (Bring Your Own Lunch) Gatherings</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                      Every Thursday from noon - 1pm we will gather with researchers in the other HCI groups for an informal BYOL (bring your own lunch). This will be a great opportunity to get to know other students working in HCI!
                    </p>

                    <h4><strong>Weekly HRI Reading Group</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        Every Tuesday at 4:00pm CST we will discuss one human-robot interaction research paper that Sarah selects. One member of the group (this will rotate) will create a brief presentation summarizing the paper with some discussion questions on the paper. We will discuss the paper as a group. These meetings will help us stay up-to-date on the most recent work in the field of HRI and provide a valuable learning environment to educate ourselves on the cutting-edge research methods and approaches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here is a suggested format for the presentations for each week:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Slide 1: Title of the paper, authors, description image from the paper</li>
                            <li>Slide 2: Summary of the methods of the paper</li>
                            <li>Slide 3: Summary of the main results of the paper</li>
                            <li>Slide 4: Strengths and weaknesses of the paper</li>
                            <li>Slide 5: 5(ish) Discussion Questions</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      You can find the list of papers we're reading and who the discussion leader is for each week on <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DpMXhLVuW17SPKmOXCnZ8XKRP1dDVP2LL7VL0nAV5p0/edit?usp=sharing">this Google spreadsheet</a></b>.

                            <li>You are working 37.5 hours per week (this is UChicago's maximum number of hours a student can work during a week)</li>
                            <li>You are working during the core work hours of 10am - 4pm (this may change depending on everyone's working hour preferences) where it's reasonable to assume that you will take a lunch break of 15 min - 1 hour somewhere in that time frame</li>
