                    <h3><strong>Getting Involved with the Lab as a UChicago Undergraduate</strong> </h3>
                    <p>
                      <b>Getting Involved.</b> The best way to get involved with the lab is by joining an ongoing research project. Research project work may entail doing literature reviews of related work to inform our intended research projects, programming robots to interact with people, designing and testing questionnaires to administer to human participants, recruiting and running human participants in our designed experiments, and analysis of data that we collect from our experiments. Once you have gained sufficient experience helping out with some research projects, you are welcome to propose your own new research project that youâ€™d like to lead.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <b>Joining a Research Project.</b> To join a research project, we recommend talking with some of the students in the lab meeting to find out what they're working on right now and if their project has room for you to join. Additionally, you can talk with Sarah to get a broader overview of the projects going on in the lab and which ones might have openings.
                    </p>

                    <h3><strong>Get Connected</strong> </h3>

                    <p>
                        The best ways to get connected with the HRI lab are to:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Join the HRI Lab Slack: <a href="https://sebolab.slack.com">https://sebolab.slack.com</a> (anyone with a @uchicago.edu email address can join). </li>
                            <li>Attend our weekly lab meetings.</li>
                            <li>Start helping out with an ongoing project in the lab -- please talk with current members and Sarah to determine what project might be a good fit for you to join.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <h3><strong>For Those Getting Started on Programming Projects</strong></h3>

                    <p>
                        If you've joined a lab project that involves robot programming, you'll want to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Get invited to our Github organization <a href="https://github.com/SeboLab">https://github.com/SeboLab</a> (you can ask one of your project team members or Sarah to add you to the Github organization)</li>
                            <li>Get familiar with ROS (the Robot Operating System), here are some recommended resources:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials">beginner tutorials on ROS.org</a></li>
                                    <li>The <a href="https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2021/spring/20600-1/ros_resources.html">ROS Resources page</a> on Sarah's Introduction to Robotics course site</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                    <h3><strong>For Those Getting Involved with Human Subjects Research Projects</strong></h3>

                    <p>
                        Research projects involving human subjects data requires those involved to 1) have completed human subjects protection training and 2) have been added to the research project's IRB (internal review board) protocol.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you have not yet completed human subjects protection training, you can find out how to complete that training on this website: <a href="https://sbsirb.uchicago.edu/training/">https://sbsirb.uchicago.edu/training/</a>. Once you complete your training, please email your certificate of completion to the project lead and they can add you to the IRB protocol.
