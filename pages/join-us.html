        <p>
          We are always looking for highly motivated students interested in human-robot interaction, human-computer interaction, and/or robotics. If you are a prospective graduate student, <strong>please apply to the <a href="https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/admissions/graduate/">UChicago CS PhD program</a> and mention your interest in working with PI Sarah Sebo in your application</strong>. The application submission deadline is typically around December 15. You can find more out online about the <a href="https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/graduate/phd-programs/">PhD program in CS at UChicago</a> and more about the UChicago HRI lab on this site. 
          <!-- If you have specific questions about applying to work as a PhD student in my group, I'm happy to respond to your questions via email (<a href="mailto:sarahsebo@uchicago.edu">sarahsebo@uchicago.edu</a>). -->
        </p>
        <p>
          PI Sarah Sebo is not available this cycle for any video calls with student applicants in advance of application submission. After reviewing your application in December/January, Sarah will reach out to you via email if she would like to schedule a video call to learn more about your background and research interests.

      <h2>Current UChicago Undergraduates and Masters Students</h2>
      
      <div class="join-section">
        <p>
          We encourage and welcome the involvement of UChicago undergraduate and Masters students in the HRI lab. UChicago undergrad and Masters students typically work collaboratively with other PhD students, undergraduates, and high school students on ongoing research projects that explore novel human-robot interactions. Work on human-robot interaction projects can include: reading academic papers to understand prior work and inform project work, experiment design, robot and system programming (typically done using Python), running a human subjects study, analyzing data, and paper writing. Students usually begin by joining an ongoing project and, if they choose, can later lead their own projects once they've gained more experience. Read below to find out more about the two primary ways you can get involved. 
        </p>

              <li><strong>Description:</strong> Summer interns work on one human-robot interaction research project in collaboration with PhD student(s), postdocs, and fellow summer interns. Students spend a majority of their time working collaboratively with their project team and also engage in several other regular meetings: a weekly lab-wide progress update meeting, a weekly project meeting with PI Sarah Sebo, and a weekly lab-wide reading group. </li>
              <li><strong>Timing & Location:</strong> Summer internships are full-time (37.5 hours/week) and typically run for 10 weeks from mid-June through the end of August. HRI lab students work in-person in John Crerar Library.</li>

        <h3>Research Assistant Position during the Academic Year</h3>

        <p>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Description:</strong> Student research assistants typically join an ongoing research project team led by a current PhD student, postdoc, or undergraduate in the lab. Beyond contributing to a specific research project, students also participate in our weekly HRI lab meeting.</li>
              <li><strong>Time Commitment:</strong> We expect students working in the lab during the school year to devote about 10 hours/week on their research project.</li>
