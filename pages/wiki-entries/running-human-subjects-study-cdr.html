        <h2>Interfacing with the CDR to Run a Human-Subjects Study</h2>

        <p>
            The main resource you will need is <a href="https://chicagobooth.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3xg9YXd0ScNpzlI">this link to the CDR research study request form</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before filling out the form, you'll need to have finalized your study design and obtained IRB approval. That being said, the first page of this form contains very helpful links to help you prepare your IRB application and study materials (e.g., <a href="https://www.chicagocdr.org/cdrlabs/mindworksIRB.pdf">this document</a> detailing what you'll need to put in your IRB to run it at Mindworks).
        </p>

        <p>
            Even before you submit a response to the CDR research study request form, we'd recommend that you reach out to a CDR staff member at the site you hope to run your resarch study. This communication can be helpful so you can get an idea about, for example:
            <ul>
                <li>if the lab has current capacity for your study when you plan to run it,</li>
                <li>what rooms are avaliable for your study,</li>
                <li>what other studies might be running at the same time,</li>
                <li>what you can expect for the current amount of walk-ins,</li>
                <li>which days are better to run studies on than others,</li>
                <li>if / how many staff will be avaliable to help run your study, etc.</li>
            </ul>

            There is often a lot of turnover with the CDR staff, so we recommend asking someone in the lab whose recently run a study at the CDR for the best person to contact for the lab you wish to run your study at.
