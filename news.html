                       <p>
                        Work in our lab led by Lauren Wright demonstrated that children experience less anxiety when reading aloud to a robot as opposed to a human adult. Published in Science Robotics (<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adu5771">link to the article here</a>) demonstrates a unique advantage that robots can have in educational settings, creating safe spaces for children to make mistakes while learning without fearing judgment. This work has already been featured in <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/robots-education-may-ease-childrens-reading-anxiety">UChicago News</a> and <a href="https://cs.uchicago.edu/news/could-robots-help-kids-conquer-reading-anxiety-new-study-from-the-department-of-computer-science-at-uchicago-suggests-so/">UChicago CS News</a>.

                        Lauren recently presented her work exploring how people respond to a robot's instructions that may undermine another robot, specifically in the context of ingroup and outgroup dynamics, at the 2025 RO-MAN Conference.

                        <p>
                            PI Sarah Sebo is a joint author of the paper RoSI A Model for Predicting Robot Social Influence that was just accepted for publication at THRI. This paper proposes a new conceptual model that predicts the level of social influence a robot has in a human-robot interaction based on two factors: violation of expectation and a person's social belonging with the robot.
